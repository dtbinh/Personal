This is the README for the Bitly Integrations Challenge

For the first part of the challenge, I completed the Race Average task using one JAVA file named RaceAverage.java
If you have NetBeans, you can open this solution as a NetBeans JAVA project and run the project. If not, all you need is
a JAVA compiler and the file can be found in the src/raceaverage folder.

This file RaceAverage.java has a main method and one other method named avgMinutes.

Once you compile and run this program, a prompt will appear asking the user to input all of the arrival times for the boats 
during the race.
Enter each arrival time for the boats formatted exactly as the instructions has them. Separate each entry by a comma, 
but there is no need for quotation marks nor spaces after the comma separating each entry. There is no need for anything once the last
entry has been added, and pressing ENTER will yield another prompt followed by the result.

Unfortunately I was unable to complete the second half of this test because, while I am familiar with using libraries, I do not know how to build APIs
or use the Bitly endpoints to create a library. I do not know how to make bitly API calls, and I am sorry for this extreme inconvenience.
I have made myself familiar with the Bitly API, and I hope that I can be taught how to do these things. If not I shall learn in the future how to accomplish these 
sorts of tasks. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me through any of the means below

Thank you very much for your time,
